            <h2>My History</h2>
            <p>
                I recently finished an 8 month internship working at General Dynamics Mission Systems as a Software Engineer.
                Alongside that internship, I have been working at a start-up tech company for almost 2 years as Project Manager

            <h2>What I can do for you</h2>
            <p>
                As a quick learner and proactive problem solver, through team projects such as my crowdsource testing android app, 
                I have obtained knowledge in areas such as object-oriented design and software development. These skills would make me a great addition to any team

            <p>
                I am great at working in teams and can adapt quickly to new working environments.
                In my free time I love to go skiing in the winter and ride my motorcyle in the summer.
                I am always looking for new opportunities.
