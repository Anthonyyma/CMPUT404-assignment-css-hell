            <p>
                I'm a student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computing science at the University of Alberta with a minor in Psychology<br><br>
                I've been interested in technology my whole life and it has always been my dream to learn about coding and work with robotics

            <h2>My History</h2>
            <p>
                I recently finished an 8 month internship working at General Dynamics Mission Systems as a Software Engineer<br><br>
                Alongside that internship, I have been working at a start-up tech company for almost 2 years as Project Manager

            <h2>What I can do for you</h2>
            <p>
                As a quick learner and proactive problem solver, through team projects such as my crowdsource testing android app, 
                I have obtained knowledge in areas such as object-oriented design and software development. These skills would make me a great addition to any team
